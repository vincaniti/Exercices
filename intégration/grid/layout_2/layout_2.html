      <h2>Usefulness of Cats</h2>
    </header>
    <aside class="side1 box">
      <p>At the office of The Morning Advertiser, I
        am informed by my old friend Mr. Charles Williams, they boast of a race
        of cats bred there for nearly half a century. In colour these are
        mostly tortoiseshell, and some are very handsome.</p>
    </aside>
    <article class="content box">
      <p>In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats?
        In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
        storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
        granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
        markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they are!
        In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still they are
        of great service.</p>

      <p>How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
        awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their
        home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes this keen
        attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!</p>

    </article>
    <aside class="side2 box">
      <p>Let any one have a plague of rats and
        mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I
        was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.</p>
